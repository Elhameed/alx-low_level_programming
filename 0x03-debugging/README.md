# 0x03. C - Debugging

In this project, I was able to learn how to fix bugs in codes using a simple method known as [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://www.thoughtfulcode.com/rubber-duck-debugging-psychology/). This is method of explaining ypur broken codes to an inanimate object like a rubber duck line by line in order to spot where the error is.

## Header File :file_folder:

* **`main.h`**: The header file containing the prototypes for all
functions written in this project can be found here: [main.h](./main.h)

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Multiple mains**: The [0-main.c](./0-main.c) file is a file that tests that the function `positive_or_negative()` gives the correct output when given a case of `0`.

* **1. Like, comment, subscribe**: In the [1-main.c](./1-main.c) file We were asked to comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop..

* **2. 0 > 972?**: The [2-largest_number.c](./2-largest_number.c) file is a fix for the initial code so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

* **3. Leap year**: The [3-print_remaining_days.c](./3-print_remaining_days.c) file contains a fix to the `print_remaining_days()` function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
