# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

In this project, I learnt what pointers and arrays are and how to use them. Also, how to use strings and how to manipulate them. 

## Header File :file_folder:

* **`main.h`**: The header file containing the prototypes for all functions written in this project can be found here: [main.h](./main.h)

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. 98 Battery st.**
  * The [0-reset_to_98.c](./0-reset_to_98.c) file contains a function that takes a pointer to an `int` as parameter and updates the value it points to to `98`.

* **1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream**
  * In the [1-swap.c](./1-swap.c) file contains a function that swaps the values of two integers.

* **2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read**
  * The [2-strlen.c](./2-strlen.c) file contains a function that returns the length of a string.

* **3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them**
  * The [3-puts.c](./3-puts.c) file contains a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to `stdout`.

* **4. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear**
  * The [4-print_rev.c](./4-print_rev.c) file contains a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

* **5. A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes**
  * In the [5-rev_string.c](./5-rev_string.c) file contains a function that reverses a string.

* **6. Half the lies they tell about me aren't true**
  * The [6-puts2.c](./6-puts2.c) file contains a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

* **7. Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half**
  * The [7-puts_half.c](./7-puts_half.c) file contains a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.

* **8. Arrays are not pointers**
  * The [8-print_array.c](./8-print_array.c) file contains a function that prints `n` elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

* **9. strcpy**
  * The [9-strcpy.c](./9-strcpy.c) file contains a function that copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte (`\0`), to the buffer pointed to by `dest`.

* **10. Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers**
  * In the [100-atoi.c](./100-atoi.c) file contains a function that convert a string to an integer.

* **11. Don't hate the hacker, hate the code**
  * The [101-keygen.c](./101-keygen.c) file contains a program that generates random valid passwords for the program [101-crackme](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x04.c).
