# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

In this project, I learnt what nested loops are and how to use them, Functions and how to use them. I also learnt the difference between the declaration and definition of functions.

## Header File :file_folder:

* [main.h](./main.h): This is the header file containing prototypes for all
functions written in the project.

| File                     | Prototype                        |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `1-alphabet.c`           | `void print_alphabet(void);`     |
| `2-print_alphabet_x10.c` | `void print_alphabet_x10(void);` |
| `3-islower.c`            | `int _islower(int c);`           |
| `4-isalpha.c`            | `int _isalpha(int c);`           |
| `5-sign.c`               | `int print_sign(int n);`         |
| `6-abs.c`                | `int _abs(int);`                 |
| `7-print_last_digit.c`   | `int print_last_digit(int);`     |
| `8-24_hours.c`           | `void jack_bauer(void);`         |
| `9-times_table.c`        | `void times_table(void)`         |
| `10-add.c`               | `int add(int, int);`             |
| `11-print_to_98.c`       | `void print_to_98(int n);`       |
| `100-times_table.c`      | `void print_times_table(int n)`  |

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. _putchar**: The [0-putchar.c](./0-putchar.c) file contains a program that prints `_putchar`, followed by a new line.

* **1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**: 
  * The [1-alphabet.c](./1-alphabet.c) file contains a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
 
* **2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**
  * This file contains a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line using `putchar` function alone.

* **3. alphABET**: The [3-print_alphabets.c](./3-print_alphabets.c) file contains a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line using only `putchar`.

* **4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off**
  * The [4-print_alphabt.c](./4-print_alphabt.c) file contains a C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line using `putchar`.

* **5. Numbers**: The [5-print_numbers.c](./5-print_numbers.c) file contains a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line.

* **6. Numberz**: The [6-print_numberz.c](./6-print_numberz.c) file contains a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line using `putchar`.

* **7. Smile in the mirror**: The [7-print_tebahpla.c](./7-print_tebahpla.c) file contains a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line using `putchar`.

* **8. Hexadecimal**: The [8-print_base16.c](./8-print_base16.c) file contains a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line using `putchar`.

* **9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success**
  * The file [9-print_comb.c](./9-print_comb.c) file contains  a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers. N.B:
    * Numbers must be separated by `,`, followed by a space
    * Numbers should be printed in ascending order
    * You can only use the `putchar` function
* **10. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need**
  * The file [100-print_comb3.c](./100-print_comb3.c) contains a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits. N.B:
    * Numbers must be separated by `,`, followed by a space
    * The two digits must be different
    * `01` and `10` are considered the same combination of the two digits `0` and `1`
 * **11. The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do...**
   * The [101-print_comb4.c](./101-print_comb4.c) file contains a program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits. N.B:
     * Numbers must be separated by `,`, followed by a space
     * The three digits must be different
     * `012`, `120`, `102`, `021`, `201`, `210` are considered the same combination of the three digits `0`, `1` and `2`
 * **12. Software is eating the World**: 
   * The [102-print_comb5.c](./102-print_comb5.c) file contains a program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers. N.B:
     * The numbers should range from `0` to `99`
     * The two numbers should be separated by a space
     * All numbers should be printed with two digits. `1` should be printed as `01`
     * The combination of numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space
     * The combinations of numbers should be printed in ascending order
     * `00` `01` and `01` `00` are considered as the same combination of the numbers `0` and `1`
     * You can only use the `putchar` function (every other function (`printf`, `puts`, etcâ€¦) is forbidden)
     * You can only use `putchar` eight times maximum in your code
     * You are not allowed to use any variable of type `char`
     * All your code should be in the `main` function
