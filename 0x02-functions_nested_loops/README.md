# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

In this project, I learnt what nested loops are and how to use them, Functions and how to use them. I also learnt the difference between the declaration and definition of functions.

## Header File :file_folder:

* **`main.h`**: The header file containing the prototypes for all
functions written in this project can be found here: [main.h](./main.h)


## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. _putchar**: The [0-putchar.c](./0-putchar.c) file contains a program that prints `_putchar`, followed by a new line.

* **1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**: 
  * The [1-alphabet.c](./1-alphabet.c) file contains a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
 
* **2. 10 x alphabet**
  * This file contains a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

* **3. islower**: The [3-islower.c](./3-islower.c) file contains a function that checks for lowercase character.It should return `1` if `c` is lowercase otherwise, it returns `0`.

* **4. isalpha**: The [4-isalpha.c](./4-isalpha.c) file contains  a function that checks for alphabetic character. It should return `1` if `c` is letter, lowercase or uppercase otherwise, it returns `0`.

* **5. Sign**: The [5-sign.c](./5-sign.c) file contains a function that prints the sign of a number. The programme should:
   * Return `1` and print `+` if `n` is greater than zero
   * Return `0` and print `0` if `n` is zero
   * Return `-1` and print `-` if `n` is less than zero

* **6. There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you
**
  * The [6-abs.c](./6-abs.c) file contains a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

* **7. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important**
   * The [7-print_last_digit.c](./7-print_last_digit.c) file contains a function that prints the last digit of a number.

* **8. I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life**
   * The [8-24_hours.c](./8-24_hours.c) file contains a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from `00:00` to `23:59`.

* **9. Learn your times table**
  * The file [9-times_table.c](./9-times_table.c) file contains a function that prints the `9` times table, starting with `0`.
 
* **10. a + b**
  * The file [10-add.c](./10-add.c) contains a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

 * **11. 98 Battery Street, the OG**
   * The [11-print_to_98.c](./11-print_to_98.c) file contains a function that prints all natural numbers from `n` to `98`, followed by a new line. N.B:
     * Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space
     * Numbers should be printed in order
     * The first printed number should be the number passed to your function
     * The last printed number should be 98
   
 * **12. The World looks like a multiplication-table, or a mathematical equation, which, turn it how you will, balances itself**: 
   * The [100-times_table.c](./100-times_table.c) file contains a function that prints the n`` times table, starting with `0`. N.B:
     * If `n` is greater than `15` or less than `0` the function should not print anything

* **13. Nature made the natural numbers; All else is the work of women**: 
   * The [101-natural.c](./101-natural.c) file contains a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of `3` or `5` below `1024` (excluded), followed by a new line.

* **14. In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A**: 
   * The [102-fibonacci.c](./102-fibonacci.c) file contains a program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with `1` and `2`, followed by a new line. N.B:
     * The numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space `,` 

* **15. Even Liber Abbaci**: 
   * The [103-fibonacci.c](./103-fibonacci.c) file contains a program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms of the Fibonacci sequence, followed by a new line.

* **16. In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A+**: 
   * The [104-fibonacci.c](./104-fibonacci.c) file contains a program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with `1` and `2`, followed by a new line. N.B:
     * The numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space `,`
