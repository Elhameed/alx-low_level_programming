# 0x00. C - Hello, World

In this project, I learnt the usage of `gcc` as a preprocessor, assembler, compiler and linker. I also learnt how to use the `printf`, `puts()` and `putchar` functions to print out programs.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

**Task-1**:The `1-listit` file contains the script that displays the content list of the working directory.`ls`

**Task-2**:The `2-bring_me_home` file contains a script that changes the working directory to the userâ€™s home directory.`cd -`

**Task-5**:The 5-listfilesdigitonly contains a script on how to display directory contents with user and group ids displayed numerically, showing hidden files in long format.`ls -n -la`

**Task-6**:The 6-firstdirectory file contains a script that creates a directory named `my_first_directory` in the `/tmp/` directory.`mkdir` `/tmp/betty` `/tmp/my_first_directory`

**Task-7**:The `7-movethatfile` file displays a script to move the file `betty` from `/tmp/` to `/tmp/my_first_directory`.

**Task-8**:The `8-firstdelete` file displays a script to delete the file `betty`.

**Task-9**:The `9-firstdirdeletion` file displays a script to delete the directory `my_first_directory` that is in the `/tmp` directory.
