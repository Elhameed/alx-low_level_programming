# 0x00. C - Hello, World

In this project, I learnt the usage of `gcc` as a preprocessor, assembler, compiler and linker. I also learnt how to use the `printf`, `puts()` and `putchar` functions to print out programs.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Preprocessor**: The `0-preprocessor` file contains script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.

* **1. Compiler**: The `1-compiler` file contains a script that compiles a C file but does not link.

* **2. Assembler**: The `2-assembler` file contains a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.

* **3. Name**: The `3-name` file contains a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`.

* **4. Hello, puts**: The `4-puts.c` file contain C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line using the function `puts`.

* **5. Hello, printf**: The `5-printf.c` file  contains a C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line using the function `printf`.

* **6. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation**: The `6-size.c` file contains a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

* **7. Intel**: The `100-intel` file contains a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.

* **8. UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity**: The `101-quote.c` file contains a C program that prints exactly `and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19`, followed by a new line, to the standard error.
