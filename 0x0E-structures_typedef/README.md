# 0x0E. C - Structures, typedef

In this project, I learnt:
  * What are structures, when, why and how to use them
  * How to use `typedef`

## Header File :file_folder:

* **`dog.h`**: The header file containing the prototypes for all functions written in this project can be found here: [dog.h](./dog.h)

| File                     | Prototype                                                               |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1-init_dog.c`           | `void init_dog(struct dog *d, char *name, float age, char *owner);`     |
| `2-print_dog.c`          | `void print_dog(struct dog *d);` |
| `4-new_dog.c`            | `dog_t *new_dog(char *name, float age, char *owner);`           |
| `5-free_dog.c`           | `void free_dog(dog_t *d);`           |

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. isupper**
  * The [0-isupper.c](./0-isupper.c) file contains a function that checks for uppercase character. It returns `1` if `c` is uppercase and returns `0` otherwise.

* **1. isdigit**
  * In the [1-isdigit.c](./1-isdigit.c) file contains a function that checks for a digit (`0` through `9`). It returns `1` if `c` is a digit and returns `0` otherwise.

* **2. Collaboration is multiplication**
  * The [2-mul.c](./2-mul.c) file contains a function that multiplies two integers.

* **3. The numbers speak for themselves**
  * The [3-print_numbers.c](./3-print_numbers.c) file contains a function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line.

* **4. I believe in numbers and signs**
  * The [4-print_most_numbers.c](./4-print_most_numbers.c) file contains a function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line without printing `2` and `4`.

* **5. Numbers constitute the only universal language**
  * In the [5-more_numbers.c](./5-more_numbers.c) file contains a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from `0` to `14`, followed by a new line.

* **6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line**
  * The [6-print_line.c](./6-print_line.c) file contains a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

* **7. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe**
  * The [7-print_diagonal.c](./7-print_diagonal.c) file contains a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

* **8. You are so much sunshine in every square inch**
  * The [8-print_square.c](./8-print_square.c) file contains a function that prints a square, followed by a new line using the character `#` to print the square.

* **9. Fizz-Buzz**
  * The [9-fizz_buzz.c](./9-fizz_buzz.c) file contains a program that prints the numbers from `1` to `100`, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`.

* **10. Triangles**
  * In the [10-print_triangle.c](./10-print_triangle.c) file contains a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line using the character `#` to print the triangle.

* **11. The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic**
  * The [100-prime_factor.c](./100-prime_factor.c) file contains a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number `612852475143`, followed by a new line.

* **12. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper**
  * The [101-print_number.c](./101-print_number.c) file contains a function that prints an integer.
