# Low-level programming & Algorithm

In this repo, you will find different programs written on low levl programming for the Alx software engineering program. I am looking forward to expanding my knowledge of C programming by constantly going through the concepts and projects provided by the school. 

* [0x00. C - Hello, World](./0x00-hello_world)
* [0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while](./0x01-variables_if_else_while)
* [0x02. C - Functions, nested loops](./0x02-functions_nested_loops)
* [0x03. C - debugging](./0x03-debugging)
* [0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops](./0x04-more_functions_nested_loops)
* [0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings)
* [0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings](./0x06-pointers_arrays_strings)

- I will continuosly update this repo with my learning progresses with hands-on projects as listed above. I believe there are more projects to come.
