# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

In this project, I learnt how to use the `if`/`if ... else`, `while` and `for` loops. I also learnt how to use `putchar` as another way of printing output apart from the commonly used `printf` function.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing**: The `0-positive_or_negative.c` file contains a program that will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed.
  * The output of the program should be:
      * The number, followed by
          * if the number is greater than 0: is positive
          * if the number is 0: is zero
          * if the number is less than 0: is negative
      * followed by a new line

* **1. Compiler**: The `1-compiler` file contains a script that compiles a C file but does not link.

* **2. Assembler**: The `2-assembler` file contains a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.

* **3. Name**: The `3-name` file contains a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun`.

* **4. Hello, puts**: The `4-puts.c` file contain C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line using the function `puts`.

* **5. Hello, printf**: The `5-printf.c` file  contains a C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line using the function `printf`.

* **6. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation**: The `6-size.c` file contains a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

* **7. Intel**: The `100-intel` file contains a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file. This should save the result in an output file of the same name but with a `.s` extension.

* **8. UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity**: The `101-quote.c` file contains a C program that prints exactly `and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19`, followed by a new line, to the standard error without using any functions listed in the NAME section of the man(3) `printf` or man(3) `puts`.
