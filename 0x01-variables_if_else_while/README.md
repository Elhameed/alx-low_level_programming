# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

In this project, I learnt how to use the `if`/`if ... else`, `while` and `for` loops. I also learnt how to use `putchar` as another way of printing output apart from the commonly used `printf` function.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing**: The [0-positive_or_negative.c](./0-positive_or_negative.c) file contains a program that will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. N.B;
  * The output of the program should be:
      * The number, followed by
          * if the number is greater than 0: is positive
          * if the number is 0: is zero
          * if the number is less than 0: is negative
      * followed by a new line

* **1. The last digit**: In this file, The output of the program should be:
  * The string Last digit of, followed by
  * n, followed by
  * the string is, followed by
    * if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
    * if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
    * if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
  * followed by a new line
 
* **2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**
  * This file contains a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line using `putchar` alone.

* **3. alphABET**: The `3-print_alphabets.c` file contains a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line using only `putchar`.

* **4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off**
  * The `4-print_alphabt.c` file contains a C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line using `putchar`.
