# 0x08. C - Recursion

In this project, I learnt the following;
  * What is recursion
  * How to implement recursion
  * In what situations you should implement recursion
  * In what situations you shouldnâ€™t implement recursion

## Header File :file_folder:

* **`main.h`**: The header file containing the prototypes for all functions written in this project can be found here: [main.h](./main.h)

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget**
  * The [0-puts_recursion.c](./0-puts_recursion.c) file contains a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

* **1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together**
  * The [1-print_rev_recursion.c](./1-print_rev_recursion.c) file contains a function that prints a string in reverse.

* **2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange**
  * The [2-strlen_recursion.c](./2-strlen_recursion.c) file contains a function that returns the length of a string.

* **3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling**
  * The [3-print_numbers.c](./3-print_numbers.c) file contains a function that returns the factorial of a given number. 
    * N.B: If `n` is lower than `0`, the function should return `-1` to indicate an error

* **4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate**
  * The [4-pow_recursion.c](./4-pow_recursion.c) file contains a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
    * N.B: If `y` is lower than `0`, the function should return `-1` to indicate an error

* **5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer**
  * The [5-sqrt_recursion.c](./5-sqrt_recursion.c) file contains a function that returns the natural square root of a number.
    * N.B: If `n` does not have a natural square root, the function should return `-1`

* **6. Inception. Is it possible?**
  * The [6-is_prime_number.c](./6-is_prime_number.c) file contains a function that returns `1` if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return `0`.

* **7. They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything**
  * The [100-is_palindrome.c](./100-is_palindrome.c) file contains a function that returns `1` if a string is a palindrome and `0` if not.

* **8. Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...**
  * The [101-wildcmp.c](./101-wildcmp.c) file contains a function that compares two strings and returns `1` if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return `0`.
