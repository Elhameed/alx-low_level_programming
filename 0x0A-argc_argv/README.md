# 0x0A. C - argc, argv

In this project, I learnt what `argc` and `argv` mean

## Header File :file_folder:

* **`main.h`**: The header file containing the prototype of the function `_putchar` written in this project can be found here: [main.h](./main.h)

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to**
  * The [0-whatsmyname.c](./0-whatsmyname.c) file contains a program that prints its name, followed by a new line. If you rename the program, it will print the new name, without having to compile it again

* **1. Silence is argument carried out by other means**
  * The [1-args.c](./1-args.c) file contains a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.

* **2. The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter**
  * The [2-args.c](./2-args.c) file contains a program that prints all arguments it receives. All arguments should be printed, including the first one. Only print one argument per line, ending with a new line
  
* **3. Neither irony nor sarcasm is argument**
  * The [3-mul.c](./3-mul.c) file a program that multiplies two numbers.

* **4. To infinity and beyond**
  * The [4-add.c](./4-add.c) file contains a program that adds positive numbers.

* **5. Minimal Number of Coins for Change**
  * The [100-change.c](./100-change.c) file contains a program that prints the minimum number of coins to make change for an amount of money.
