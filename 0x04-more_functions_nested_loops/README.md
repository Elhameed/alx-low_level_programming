# 0x04-more_functions

This project served as a revision of my knowledge on nested loops, header files, and declaration/ definition of functions.

## Header File :file_folder:

* **`main.h`**: The header file containing the prototypes for all functions written in this project can be found here: [main.h](./main.h)

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. isupper**
  * The [0-isupper.c](./0-isupper.c) file contains a function that checks for uppercase character. It returns `1` if `c` is uppercase and returns `0` otherwise.

* **1. isdigit**
  * In the [1-isdigit.c](./1-isdigit.c) file contains a function that checks for a digit (`0` through `9`). It returns `1` if `c` is a digit and returns `0` otherwise.

* **2. Collaboration is multiplication**
  * The [2-mul.c](./2-mul.c) file contains a function that multiplies two integers.

* **3. The numbers speak for themselves**
  * The [3-print_numbers.c](./3-print_numbers.c) file contains a function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line.
